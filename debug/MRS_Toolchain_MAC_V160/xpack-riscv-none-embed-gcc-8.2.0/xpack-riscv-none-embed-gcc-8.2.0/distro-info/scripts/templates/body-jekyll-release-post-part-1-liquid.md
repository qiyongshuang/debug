[The xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC](https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of the
[SiFive RISC-V GCC](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (Intel 32/64-bit),
**macOS** (Intel 64-bit) and **GNU/Linux** (Intel 32/64-bit, Arm 64-bit).

{% raw %}{% include note.html content="The main targets for the Arm binaries
are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices." %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% include note.html content="Due to memory limitations during the build, there is no Arm 32-bit image." %}{% endraw %}

## Download

The binary files are available from GitHub [Releases]({% raw %}{{ page.download_url }}{% endraw %}).

## Prerequisites

- Intel GNU/Linux 32/64-bit: any system with **GLIBC 2.15** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 12 or later, Debian 8 or later, RedHat/CentOS 7 later,
  Fedora 20 or later, etc)
- Arm GNU/Linux 64-bit: any system with **GLIBC 2.23** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 16 or later, Debian 9 or later, RedHat/CentOS 8 or later,
  Fedora 24 or later, etc); (there is no Arm 32-bit image!);
- Intel Windows 32/64-bit: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10
- Intel macOS 64-bit: 10.13 or later

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** on various platforms
are presented in the separate
[Install]({% raw %}{{ site.baseurl }}{% endraw %}/riscv-none-embed-gcc/install/) page.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC is with
[`xpm`]({% raw %}{{ site.baseurl }}{% endraw %}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

With the `xpm` tool available, installing
the latest version of the package and adding it as
a dependency for a project is quite easy:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Only at first use.

xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc@latest

ls -l xpacks/.bin
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc@{% raw %}{{ page.version }}.{{ page.npm_subversion }}{% endraw %}
```

For xPacks aware tools, like the **Eclipse Embedded C/C++ plug-ins**,
it is also possible to install GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC globally, in the user home folder.

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc@latest
```

Eclipse will automatically
identify binaries installed with
`xpm` and provide a convenient method to manage paths.

### Uninstall

To remove the links from the current project:

```sh
cd my-project

xpm uninstall @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc
```

To completely remove the package from the global store:

```sh
xpm uninstall --global @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc
```

## Compliance

The xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC generally follows the official
SiFive RISC-V GCC [releases](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases)),
with as little differences as possible.

The current version is based on:

- SiFive RISC-V GCC release **{% raw %}{{ page.sifive_version }}{% endraw %}** from {% raw %}{{ page.sifive_date }}{% endraw %},
and includes the SiFive extensions, including the RVV vector support.

## Supported libraries

The supported libraries are:

```console
$ riscv-none-embed-gcc -print-multi-lib
...
```

## Changes

There are no functional changes.

### Improvements

Compared to the original SiFive version, the **same architecture and API**
options are supported, and there are minimal functional changes

- `libgloss` was removed from the list of libraries always linked to the
  application, since it issues `ECALL`
  instructions that fail in bare metal environments

### newlib-nano

Support for **newlib-nano** is available using the
`--specs=nano.specs` option. For better results, this option must be
added to both compile and link time.

### nosys.specs

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link
time to provide empty implementations for the POSIX system calls.

### Compile options

The libraries are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`. The nano version is
compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medany`.

{% raw %}{% include important.html content="It is mandatory for the applications to
be compiled with
`-mcmodel=medany`, otherwise the link will fail." %}{% endraw %}

### Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python 3.7**.

The Python 3 run-time is included, so GDB does not need any version of
Python to be installed, and is insensitive to the presence of other
versions.

Support for Python 2 was discontinued.

### Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

{% raw %}{% include note.html content="TUI is not available on Windows." %}{% endraw %}

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- due to the very large number of instructions added by the vector support
  (~70K), the compiler sources became too large and it was not possible to build the Arm 32-bit image
  ([#229](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/issues/229))
- the archive size got too big for the Windows 32-bit node to handle, and
  `xpm install` may fail with _RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed_;
  the 64-bit systems are not affected.

## Shared libraries

On all platforms the packages are standalone, and expect only the standard
runtime to be present on the host.

All dependencies that are build as shared libraries are copied locally
in the `libexec` folder (or in the same folder as the executable for Windows).

### `DT_RPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

On GNU/Linux the binaries are adjusted to use a relative path:

```console
$ readelf -d library.so | grep runpath
 0x000000000000001d (RPATH)            Library rpath: [$ORIGIN]
```

In the GNU ld.so search strategy, the `DT_RPATH` has
the highest priority, higher than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so if this later one
is set in the environment, it should not interfere with the xPack binaries.

Please note that previous versions, up to mid-2020, used `DT_RUNPATH`, which
has a priority lower than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and does not tolerate setting
it in the environment.

### `@executable_path`

Similarly, on macOS, the dynamic libraries are adjusted with `otool` to use a
relative path.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and Intel & Arm GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[How to build](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-BUILD.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/actions/)
- [travis-ci.com](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.
